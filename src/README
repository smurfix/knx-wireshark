This is a short description of the KNXnet/IP Wireshark dissector. The project is hosted on http://knxnetipdissect.sourceforge.net/.
Documentation can be found at the project website or in the doc-directory of the source.

NOTE: The original author forgot to check in the configure.ac file, 
thus the Makefile.am is useless. For the time being I have included a
simple build script.
